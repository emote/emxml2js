emxml2js
========

THIS IS OBSOLETE!

The functionality it adds (described below) has been integrated into xmlsj2 
version 0.2.3, which should be used instead.  The code in this repository 
will not be maintained.

-------------------------------------------------------------
A fork of xml2js (https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js.git), that includes additional namespace processing

This supports the same options listed at 
https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js/blob/master/README.md, plus

* xmlns (default : false), which if set to true will annotate each
  element with its namespace and local name.
